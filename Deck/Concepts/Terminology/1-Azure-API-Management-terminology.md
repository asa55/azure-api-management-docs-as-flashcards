Backend API - A service, most commonly **HTTP**-based, that implements an API and its operations. Sometimes backend APIs are referred to simply as backends.

##

`_____` API - API Management serves as mediation layer over the backend APIs. `_____` API is an API that is exposed to API consumers from API Management. You can customize the shape and behavior of a `_____` API in API Management without making changes to the backend API(s) that it represents. Sometimes `_____` APIs are referred to simply as APIs.

**Frontend** API - API Management serves as mediation layer over the backend APIs. **Frontend** API is an API that is exposed to API consumers from API Management. You can customize the shape and behavior of a **frontend** API in API Management without making changes to the backend API(s) that it represents. Sometimes **frontend** APIs are referred to simply as APIs.

##

`_____` - A `_____` is a bundle of frontend APIs that can be made available to a specified group of API consumers for self-service onboarding under a single access credential and a set of usage limits. An API can be part of multiple `_____`.

%

**Product** - A **product** is a bundle of frontend APIs that can be made available to a specified group of API consumers for self-service onboarding under a single access credential and a set of usage limits. An API can be part of multiple **products**.

##

API `_____` - A frontend API in API Management can define multiple `_____`. An `_____` is a combination of an HTTP verb and a URL template uniquely resolvable within the frontend API. Often `_____` map one-to-one to backend API endpoints.

%

API **operation** - A frontend API in API Management can define multiple **operations**. An **operation** is a combination of an HTTP verb and a URL template uniquely resolvable within the frontend API. Often **operations** map one-to-one to backend API endpoints.

##

`_____` - A `_____` is a distinct variant of existing frontend API that differs in shape or behavior from the original. `_____` give customers a choice of sticking with the original API or upgrading to a new version at the time of their choosing. `_____` are a mechanism for releasing breaking changes without impacting API consumers.

%

**Version** - A **version** is a distinct variant of existing frontend API that differs in shape or behavior from the original. **Versions** give customers a choice of sticking with the original API or upgrading to a new version at the time of their choosing. **Versions** are a mechanism for releasing breaking changes without impacting API consumers.

##

`_____` - A `_____` is a copy of an existing API that can be changed without impacting API consumers and swapped with the version currently in use by consumers usually after validation and testing. `_____` provide a mechanism for safely implementing nonbreaking changes.

%

**Revision** - A **revision** is a copy of an existing API that can be changed without impacting API consumers and swapped with the version currently in use by consumers usually after validation and testing. **Revisions** provide a mechanism for safely implementing nonbreaking changes.

##

`_____` - A `_____` is a reusable and composable component, implementing some commonly used API-related functionality. API Management offers over 50 built-in `_____` that take care of critical but undifferentiated horizontal concerns - for example, request transformation, routing, security, protection, caching. The `_____` can be applied at various scopes, which determine the affected APIs or operations and dynamically configured using `_____` expressions.

%

**Policy** - A **policy** is a reusable and composable component, implementing some commonly used API-related functionality. API Management offers over 50 built-in **policies** that take care of critical but undifferentiated horizontal concerns - for example, request transformation, routing, security, protection, caching. The **policies** can be applied at various scopes, which determine the affected APIs or operations and dynamically configured using **policy** expressions.

##

`_____` portal - The `_____` portal is a component of API Management. It provides a customizable experience for API discovery and self-service onboarding to API consumers.
